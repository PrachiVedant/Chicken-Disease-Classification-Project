## Overview

Chicken Disease Classification Project is designed to automate and improve the detection of diseases in chickens using computer vision and deep learning. It helps poultry farmers, veterinarians, and researchers with rapid, accurate diagnosis, reducing losses and improving animal welfare. The solution is scalable, modular, and easy to extend for new diseases or environments.

---

## Workflow

Follow these steps to configure, run, and maintain the project:

1. **Update `config.yaml`**  
   - Customize global settings such as data paths, model parameters, and output locations.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     data_dir: data/
     model_dir: models/
     epochs: 50
     batch_size: 32
     learning_rate: 0.001
     ```

2. **Update `params.yaml`**  
   - Set hyperparameters and experiment variables for reproducibility.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     optimizer: adam
     dropout: 0.3
     image_size: [224, 224]
     ```

3. **Update the Entity**  
   - Modify core data structures (like dataclasses) in `src/entity/` if you add new disease classes or change schema.

4. **Update the Configuration Manager (`src/config`)**  
   - Ensure your Configuration Manager reads and validates all updated config keys. This helps avoid errors during runtime.

5. **Update the Components**  
   - Components in `src/components/` like data loaders, model builders, trainers, and evaluators should be adjusted to align with the new configs and entities.

6. **Update the Pipeline**  
   - Modify the main pipeline script in `src/pipeline/` to integrate new or updated components. Ensure the flow reflects all your changes.

7. **Update `main.py`**  
   - Make sure `main.py` properly calls the pipeline, loads updated configs, and accepts new arguments or options.

8. **Update `dvc.yaml`**  
   - Add or adjust stages in `dvc.yaml` to reflect new or changed pipeline steps.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       preprocess:
         cmd: python src/pipeline/preprocess.py
         deps:
           - data/raw
           - src/pipeline/preprocess.py
         outs:
           - data/processed
       train:
         cmd: python main.py --mode train
         deps:
           - data/processed
           - main.py
         outs:
           - models/model.pt
     ```
   - Run `dvc repro` to execute the updated pipeline and verify all stages.

- **Contents:** Labeled images of healthy and diseased chickens, annotated by experts.
- **Preprocessing:** Automated scripts for cleaning, augmentation, and splitting data.

---

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model:** ResNet50 or your chosen architecture.
- **Techniques:** Transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuning.
- **Framework:** PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras).
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Package Manager:** pip (or conda)
- **Recommended:** GPU for faster training

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrachiVedant/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd Chicken-Disease-Classification-Project
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **(Optional) Setup virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

---

## Usage

### Run the project

```bash
python main.py --mode train --config configs/config.yaml
```
- `--mode`: Can be `train`, `test`, or `predict`
- `--config`: Path to configuration file

### Predict new images

```bash
python main.py --mode predict --input path/to/image.jpg
```

---

## Testing

Run unit tests and validation scripts:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## Results

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| ResNet50     | 95.2%    | 94.8%     | 95.0%  | 94.9%    |
| EfficientNet | 96.1%    | 95.9%     | 96.0%  | 95.9%    |

Confusion matrix and ROC curves are available in the `results/` directory.
